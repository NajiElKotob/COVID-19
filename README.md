Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)


Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, 
fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by 
washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact 
(1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)
